# GD playing tips
* Turn off vsync and smooth fix. This is super important to uncancer your gameplay.
* Use higher FPS. That really makes the difference, game reacts more accurately to your clicks at higher FPS. It may broke some levels: try fixing them in editor.
* Prefer Practice Mode over StartPoses. The latter are buggy (mostly for low FPS).
* Ignore Daily/Weekly levels, Map Packs, cases, etc. These features are meant just for grinding and also Daily/Weekly menus tend to crash the game.
* Enable UHD textures. These don't affect performance really.
* Consider enabling global LDM and setting a texture pack.
